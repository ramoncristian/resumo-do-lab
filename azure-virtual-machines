Creating a Windows virtual machine (VM) in the Azure Portal is a straightforward process. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

üß∞ Prerequisites
Azure Subscription: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription. If not, you can create a free account.

Azure Portal Access: Sign in to the Azure Portal.

Remote Desktop Client: For Windows, the built-in Remote Desktop Connection is sufficient. For macOS, consider using the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Windows VM
1. Navigate to Virtual Machines
In the Azure Portal, use the search bar at the top to search for "Virtual machines".

Click on "Virtual machines" under the "Services" section.

2. Initiate VM Creation
Click on the "+ Create" button.

Select "Azure virtual machine" from the dropdown.

3. Configure Basic Settings
On the Basics tab:

Subscription: Choose your Azure subscription.

Resource Group: Select an existing resource group or click "Create new" to create one.

Virtual Machine Name: Enter a name for your VM (e.g., MyWindowsVM).

Region: Choose the Azure region closest to your users or resources.

Availability Options: For this tutorial, you can leave it as "No infrastructure redundancy required".

Image: Click on the dropdown and select "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen2".

Size: Click on "See all sizes" to choose a VM size that fits your needs. For testing purposes, Standard_D2s_v3 is a common choice.

Administrator Account:

Username: Enter a username (e.g., azureuser).

Password: Enter a strong password that meets Azure's complexity requirements.

Inbound Port Rules:

Public Inbound Ports: Select "Allow selected ports".

Select Inbound Ports: Choose RDP (3389) to enable remote desktop access.

4. Disks Configuration
Navigate to the Disks tab.

OS Disk Type: Choose between Premium SSD, Standard SSD, or Standard HDD based on performance and cost requirements.

For this tutorial, you can leave the default settings.

5. Networking Configuration
Navigate to the Networking tab.

Virtual Network: Use the default or create a new one.

Subnet: Use the default or create a new one.

Public IP: Ensure a new public IP is created to allow RDP access.

NIC Network Security Group: Use the default settings, which will include the RDP rule you set earlier.

6. Management, Monitoring, and Advanced Options
For the Management, Monitoring, Advanced, and Tags tabs, you can leave the default settings for this basic setup.

7. Review and Create
Navigate to the Review + create tab.

Azure will validate your configuration. If there are any issues, they will be highlighted here.

Once validation passes, click on the "Create" button.

Azure will now begin deploying your virtual machine. This process may take a few minutes.

üîó Connecting to Your Windows VM
Once the deployment is complete:

Access the VM:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to "Virtual machines".

Click on your newly created VM (e.g., MyWindowsVM).

Connect via RDP:

Click on the "Connect" button at the top.

Choose "RDP" from the dropdown.

In the "Connect with RDP" blade:

Click on "Download RDP File".

Open the downloaded .rdp file.

When prompted, enter the username and password you set during VM creation.

Security Prompt:

You may receive a certificate warning. It's safe to proceed by clicking "Yes".

You are now connected to your Windows virtual machine.

üßπ Post-Deployment Considerations
Install Necessary Software: Once connected, you can install any software or tools you need on the VM.

Configure Firewall Rules: If you plan to host services, ensure the necessary ports are open in both the Windows Firewall and Azure NSG.

Regular Updates: Keep your VM updated with the latest Windows updates and patches.

Backup and Recovery: Consider setting up Azure Backup to protect your VM data.
